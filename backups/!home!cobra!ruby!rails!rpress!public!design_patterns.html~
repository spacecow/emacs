<h2>Flyweight Pattern</h2>
A flyweight patterns is an object that minimises memory use by sharing
as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to
use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation
would use an unacceptable amount of memory. In other contexts the idea
of sharing data structures is called <i>hash consing</i>.
