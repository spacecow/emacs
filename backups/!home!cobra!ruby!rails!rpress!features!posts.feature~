Feature: Post Management & Display
	In order to provide quality content
	As an author
	I need to be able to manage posts

Scenario: Show Posts
Given a user exists with name: "Johan Sveholm"
When I go to the new post page
	And I fill in "Title" with "My Post Title"
	And I fill in "Body" with "This is still my post."
	And I select "Johan Sveholm" from "Author"
	And I fill in "Published on" with "Jul 22, 2010"
	And I press "Save Post"
Then I should see "My Post Title"
	And I should see "This is still my post."
