Scenario Outline: If a class exists doubled, the one in use should be displayed
Given a course: "ruby" exists with name: "Ruby I"
And coure: "ruby" is one of user: "junko"'s student_courses
And a klass: "klass16-1" exists with date: "2010-03-18", course: course "ruby"

And a user is logged in as "johan"
When I browse to the reserve page for user: "johan" for "03/15ï½ž03/20"
Then I should see "3/18(Thursday) - Ruby I - 12:00~13:00" within "div.reserved"
	And the page should have no "reservable" section
Examples:
|	klass			|
